# Firebase Local Environment Setup

This skill documents the bare minimum setup required for a full Firebase experience for the agent. Before starting to use any Firebase features, you MUST verify that each of the following steps has been completed.

## 1. Install Node.js
Firebase tools require Node.js version 20 or higher.

**Verification:**
Run `node --version`.

**Action if missing or version < 20:**
Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or use a version manager like `nvm`.

## 2. Ensure Firebase CLI is Available
The Firebase CLI is the primary tool for interacting with Firebase services.

**Verification & Setup:**
Run the following command to ensure the latest version of the Firebase CLI is available via `npx`:
```bash
npx -y firebase-tools@latest --version
```

## 3. Log In to Firebase
You must authenticate with your Google account to manage Firebase projects.

**Verification:**
Run `npx -y firebase-tools@latest login` to ensure you are logged in.

*Note: If you are in a remote shell or a restricted environment where a browser cannot be opened, use `npx -y firebase-tools@latest login --no-localhost`.*

## 4. Installing extension/plugin
To get the most out of Firebase, you should install the Firebase agent skills and the Firebase MCP server. For many agents, this can be done through a single extension or plugin installation.

Choose your agent for detailed setup instructions:
- **Gemini CLI**: See [references/gemini_cli.md](references/gemini_cli.md)
- **Antigravity**: See [references/antigravity.md](references/antigravity.md)
- **Claude Code**: See [references/claude_code.md](references/claude_code.md)
- **Cursor**: See [references/cursor.md](references/cursor.md)
- **GitHub Copilot**: See [references/github_copilot.md](references/github_copilot.md)
- **Other Agents**: (Windsurf, Cline, etc.) See [references/other_agents.md](references/other_agents.md)

*Note: If both agent skills and MCP server can be installed through an extension or plugin, we recommend that method by default.*

**Crucial:** Do not proceed with any other Firebase tasks until every step above has been verified and completed.
